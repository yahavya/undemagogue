undemagogue is a web application designed to help you better understand who of the people you follow on X (formerly Twitter) are spreading fake news/hate. Using LLMs, we process tweets and rate them using a hate score (between 1 and 100). You are recommended to unfollow people who have a high overall hate score (this usually means their tweets spread hate, are not factually accurate, etc). This is our small contribution to fighting the spread of hate and fake news online.
